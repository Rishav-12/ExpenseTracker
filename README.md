# ExpenseTracker
Simple app to track your expenses, maybe on a trip/vacation

### Motivation
I worked on a full project in Java after almost 3 years

### How to use
* Command-line application
* Open cmd in the directory where the .java file is present
* To run the application, type the following, hitting Enter after each
  ```console
  javac expensetracker.java
  java expensetracker
  ```
* Put in the various payments made
* The program calculates how much each person has to pay such that everyone pays equally
